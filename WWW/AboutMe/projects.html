            <p> A short game created in Gamemaker Game Engine. Includes 3 different basic enemies and
                two boss fights. Player can upgrade his skills after surviving an enemy wave. The game
                has a menu, good movement and fight mechanics and a simple music. Unfortunately all game 
                files have been formatted when I changed the OS, and the only thing left is game's build.
