            <h1>Interests</h1>

            <h2>2D Games</h2>
            <p>My interest in making 2D games started when I was in primary school
                and made a console snake game in C++. Then I went on to making 
                simple platformers in Gamemaker. In University I made a two small games
                one of which I made with my brother who made all the graphics.

            <h2>Fractals</h2>
            <p>I like how simple the fractals are and yet programming one
                gives beautiful results. It is nice to thing that there's 
                harmony in math.

            <p>I was raised in a village next to Karkonoski National Park
                and I love coming back to my mountains to enjoy the views.
